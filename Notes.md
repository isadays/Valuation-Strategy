### Real Options in Venture Capital

Real options refer to choices on whether and how to proceed with business investments. Real options analysis gives management the
flexibility to decide to delay, expand, abandon or reposition investments. Like
financial options, real options have value under uncertainty. Depending on the
resolution of uncertainty in the future, management has the choice – but not the obligation – to
exercise its options.

![Staged Financing](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/Stagedfinancing.png)

Start-up Financing (Stage 1):
Initial Option: The investor commits capital to the start-up. This initial investment is akin to purchasing an option. The investor has the right, but not the obligation, to participate in future financing rounds.
Uncertainty: At this stage, the future success of the start-up is highly uncertain. The value of this option depends on the potential for the start-up to progress to subsequent stages.

A Round Financing (Stage 2):
Second Option: If the start-up shows promise, the investor can choose to invest in the A round. This investment is contingent upon the outcomes and milestones achieved during the start-up phase.
Growth Option: Investing in the A round provides the investor with the option to further invest in the B round, should the start-up continue to grow and meet set criteria.
Valuation: The value of the A round option increases if the start-up's performance reduces uncertainty and increases future growth prospects.

B Round Financing (Stage 3):
Third Option: Upon successful completion of the A round, the investor can choose to participate in the B round. This stage typically requires more substantial investment but also comes with higher potential returns.

Continued Growth Option: This investment opens the door to the C round financing, representing another growth option for the investor.

Risk and Return: The risk is reduced compared to earlier stages due to increased information and reduced uncertainty, but the investment amount is higher.
C Round Financing:
Final Option: If the start-up has performed well in the B round, the investor can choose to invest in the C round. This stage is usually aimed at scaling the business significantly, often preparing for an IPO or acquisition.
Maximized Value: At this point, the investor’s option is close to maturity. The potential returns are highest, but the associated risk is minimized due to the substantial amount of information and progress made by the start-up.
Growth Options Value Under Uncertainty

Flexibility: Each stage offers the investor the flexibility to wait for more information before committing additional funds. This flexibility to defer investment until uncertainty is resolved adds significant value.
Strategic Decision Making: Investors can make informed decisions based on the start-up’s performance at each stage. Poor performance may lead to terminating further investment, while good performance can prompt additional funding.
Valuation Under Uncertainty: The value of each option (financing round) is influenced by the underlying asset (the start-up). As uncertainty decreases with each successful stage, the value of subsequent options increases.
Dynamic Adjustment: Investors can dynamically adjust their strategies based on market conditions, start-up performance, and new information, optimizing their investment portfolio over time.

Staged financing under uncertainty, viewed as a series of real options, allows investors to manage risk and maximize potential returns. Each financing stage represents an option that provides the flexibility to invest further based on the performance and reduced uncertainty of the start-up. This strategic approach to investment leverages the principles of real options to make informed, value-maximizing decisions at each stage of the start-up’s growth.

### Growth Option Value in a Serial Acquisition Strategy

In 2001, Xstrata was a nondescript Swiss-listed ferrochrome and zinc business attached to Glencore, a metals trading house. Subsequently Xstrata completed a series of acquisitions, including Glencore’s coal assets in 2002; MIM – the Australian coal, copper and zinc group – in 2003; the Tintaya copper mine in Peru, a one-third share of the Cerrejon coal mine in Colombia and the acquisition of Falconbridge in Canada, all in 2006. In the short time span of five years, this journey transformed Xstrata from a minor into a major miner. These transactions were part of an acquisition strategy known as “buy-and-build,” in which an equity investor initially undertakes a “platform” acquisition in an industry and then leverages core competencies or efficiencies onto follow-on acquisitions in a broadened geographical base. The goal of such a strategy is targeted industry consolidation. 


![Staged Financing II Example](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/Staged2.png)


Platform Acquisition: Initial Compound Real Option: The first acquisition, or platform acquisition, is a foundational investment that creates opportunities for subsequent acquisitions. This initial investment can be seen as a compound real option because it not only has intrinsic value but also generates additional real options for future growth.
Uncertainty and Strategic Positioning: The value of this platform acquisition is driven by the potential to leverage core competencies, realize synergies, and achieve economies of scale. The initial uncertainty is high, but successful integration can significantly enhance strategic positioning.

Follow-on Acquisitions: Subsequent Real Options: Each follow-on acquisition (such as acquiring coal assets, copper mines, or additional shares in other mining operations) represents an exercise of the real options created by the platform acquisition. These acquisitions are contingent on the success of the platform acquisition and each subsequent step.
Growth and Expansion: The value of follow-on acquisitions is derived from the potential to expand geographically, integrate operations, and enhance market presence. Each successful acquisition reduces uncertainty and increases the value of future options.
Factors Driving the Option Value

Strategic Synergies and Economies of Scale: Operational Efficiency: The ability to integrate new acquisitions seamlessly into the existing operations enhances efficiency and reduces costs. Market Power: Expanding the geographic and operational footprint increases market power, allowing for better negotiation terms and pricing power.
Flexibility and Timing:

Staged Investment: The serial nature of the acquisitions provides flexibility in timing and execution. Investors can wait for favorable conditions before exercising the next option, thereby managing risk.Response to Market Conditions: The strategy allows for dynamic adjustment based on market conditions, industry trends, and competitive actions.

Risk Management:

Diversification: Acquiring assets in different regions and commodities diversifies the risk portfolio. This reduces the impact of adverse conditions in any single market.
Information Gained: Each acquisition provides valuable information that can be used to inform and optimize subsequent investments.
Value Creation Through Integration: Operational Improvements: Integration of acquired assets can lead to significant operational improvements and cost savings.
Resource Optimization: Efficient use of resources across a larger operational base enhances productivity and profitability.


Example: Xstrata’s Acquisition Strategy
2002: Acquisition of Glencore’s coal assets (Platform acquisition)
Value Driver: Immediate access to valuable coal assets and synergy with existing operations.
Next Option Created: Potential for further acquisitions in the coal sector.

2003: Acquisition of MIM (Australian coal, copper, and zinc group)
Value Driver: Expansion into new commodities and geographical regions.
Next Option Created: Potential for growth in the copper and zinc markets.

2006: Multiple Acquisitions (Tintaya copper mine, Cerrejon coal mine, Falconbridge)
Value Driver: Significant expansion in copper and coal markets, increased market share, and enhanced operational efficiencies.
Next Option Created: Further consolidation in the mining industry and potential for additional strategic acquisitions.


In a serial acquisition strategy, each acquisition serves as a real option that creates further opportunities for growth. The initial platform acquisition is a compound real option that generates subsequent real options, driving the overall value through strategic synergies, operational efficiencies, risk management, and dynamic flexibility. The success of this strategy hinges on the ability to leverage core competencies, integrate new assets effectively, and respond to market conditions, ultimately leading to significant growth and value creation.

### Expanded Net Present Value (NPV)

#### Expanded NPV of a Platform Acquisition

The expanded Net Present Value (NPV) approach incorporates the traditional NPV of an investment project and extends it to include the value of real options associated with the project. For a platform acquisition, the expanded NPV considers not only the immediate cash flows from the acquisition but also the strategic value of future growth opportunities enabled by the acquisition. Here are the components of an expanded NPV:

#### 1. Traditional NPV of the Platform Acquisition

**Traditional NPV (TNPV)** is calculated as the present value of the expected cash flows from the initial investment, discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted rate. This includes:

- **Initial Investment (I):** The upfront cost of acquiring the platform.
- **Expected Cash Flows (CF):** The future cash flows generated by the platform acquisition.
- **Discount Rate (r):** The risk-adjusted rate used to discount future cash flows.

\[ \text{TNPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} - I \]

#### 2. Real Options Value (ROV)

Real options provide the strategic flexibility to make future investments contingent on the success of the platform acquisition. The value of these options includes:

##### a. Growth Options
- **Follow-on Investments:** Opportunities to make additional investments in related assets or expansions. These options are valuable if the platform acquisition is successful and market conditions are favorable.
- **Geographic Expansion:** The option to expand into new regions using the platform as a base.
- **Product Line Expansion:** The option to introduce new products or services leveraging the platform’s capabilities.

##### b. Abandonment Option
- **Option to Abandon:** The option to cease operations or sell the platform if it does not perform as expected, thereby limiting losses.

##### c. Switching Option
- **Operational Flexibility:** The option to switch resources, such as changing production processes or reallocating assets, to respond to market conditions.

The value of these real options (ROV) can be estimated using option pricing models like the Black-Scholes model or binomial models, adapted for real options.

#### 3. Expanded NPV Calculation

The expanded NPV (ENPV) is the sum of the traditional NPV and the value of the real options:

\[ \text{ENPV} = \text{TNPV} + \text{ROV} \]

Where:
- **ENPV:** Expanded Net Present Value.
- **TNPV:** Traditional Net Present Value.
- **ROV:** Real Options Value.

#### Example Calculation

Consider a platform acquisition with the following details:
- Initial Investment (I): $100 million
- Expected Cash Flows (CF): $20 million annually for 5 years
- Discount Rate (r): 10%
- Real Options Value (ROV): $30 million

##### Step 1: Calculate Traditional NPV

\[ \text{TNPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{5} \frac{20}{(1+0.10)^t} - 100 \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \text{TNPV} = \frac{20}{1.1} + \frac{20}{1.21} + \frac{20}{1.331} + \frac{20}{1.4641} + \frac{20}{1.61051} - 100 \]

\[ \text{TNPV} = 18.18 + 16.53 + 15.03 + 13.67 + 12.42 - 100 \]

\[ \text{TNPV} = 75.83 - 100 \]

\[ \text{TNPV} = -24.17 \text{ million} \]

#### Step 2: Add Real Options Value

\[ \text{ENPV} = \text{TNPV} + \text{ROV} \]

\[ \text{ENPV} = -24.17 + 30 \]

\[ \text{ENPV} = 5.83 \text{ million} \]

In this example, although the traditional NPV is negative, the positive value of the real options associated with the platform acquisition makes the overall project worthwhile. The expanded NPV approach highlights the strategic value of future growth opportunities and flexibility, which are crucial in evaluating investment decisions under uncertainty.


### Calculating Present Value of Growth Opportunities

With the “market method,” we can deduce the market’s perception of strategic growth option value from share prices. Any value that is embedded in a company’s market value and cannot be reconciled by the value of its assets in place represents the value of its growth opportunities. 

Suppose that:
- The market value (share price multiplied by outstanding shares) of the company equals $80 billion.
- The value of assets in place of the company, estimated as the discounted value of earnings under a no-growth policy, equals $50 billion.

#### Estimating the Strategic Growth Option Value (PVGO)

To estimate the strategic growth option value, also known as the present value of the growth opportunities (PVGO), we use the following formula:

\[ \text{PVGO} = \text{Market Value} - \text{Value of Assets in Place} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{PVGO} = 80 \text{ billion} - 50 \text{ billion} \]

\[ \text{PVGO} = 30 \text{ billion} \]

Therefore, the present value of the growth opportunities (PVGO) for this company is **$30 billion**. This means that $30 billion of the company's market value is attributed to its expected future growth opportunities beyond the value of its existing assets.


### Real Option to Defer in the Oil Industry

 In 2012 the company Artic Oil contemplates to start exploration drillings in Nova Scotia. This allowed them to invest a limited amount in 2012 to perform initial explorations before fully investing in 2015 a complete drilling platform and start production. That is, they purchased an option on the value of future oil production.

 ![Option Value](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/OptionValue.png)

 Management is analyzing the initial decision in 2012 to start exploration drillings. As their financial expert you explain to the management of Artic Oil how in 2012  the initial explorations were viewed as obtaining a real option. You decide to explain it to them using option theory and draw them a graph of the  option where they can decide to invest in the future depending on the evolution of oil prices.

Use the figure below to explain how the future investment in the production facilities in 2015 depends on the evolution of the oil price. Draw the time (option) value (as of 2012) of this pay-off in the figure.

### Real Option to Defer in the Oil Industry

### Explanation Using Option Theory

Management is analyzing the initial decision in 2012 to start exploration drillings. As their financial expert, you explain to the management of Artic Oil how in 2012 the initial explorations were viewed as obtaining a real option. You decide to explain it to them using option theory and draw them a graph of the option where they can decide to invest in the future depending on the evolution of oil prices.

##### Option Pay-off Structure

- **X-axis (Value):** Represents the value of the underlying asset (oil prices).
- **Y-axis (Option Pay-off):** Represents the pay-off from exercising the option.
- **Investment in 2012:** The initial exploration investment acts as an option premium.
- **Investment in 2015:** The decision point where the company can choose to make a significant investment in production facilities.
- **No Additional Investments:** If oil prices do not rise sufficiently, the company may choose not to invest further, limiting their losses to the initial exploration cost.
- **Invest:** If oil prices increase favorably, the company will exercise the option and invest in production, potentially leading to significant pay-offs.

##### Time Value of the Option (as of 2012)

The graph demonstrates the timeline of investments and the associated option value:
- **Exploration (2012):** A small investment is made to obtain initial exploration data.
- **Production (2015):** A larger investment decision is made based on the oil prices and the data obtained from the initial exploration.

#### Key Points in Option Theory

1. **Option Premium (Initial Exploration Investment):**
   - The initial exploration in 2012 is akin to paying a premium for an option. It provides the company with the right to make a larger investment in the future.

2. **Exercise Decision (2015 Investment):**
   - The option will only be exercised if it is profitable to do so. In this case, if oil prices have risen sufficiently to justify the cost of building a drilling platform and starting production, the company will proceed with the investment.

3. **Pay-off Structure:**
   - The pay-off from exercising the option depends on the future value of oil prices. If prices are high, the pay-off is substantial. If prices are low, the company can choose not to invest further, thus limiting its losses to the initial exploration cost.

4. **Time Value:**
   - The time value of the option reflects the potential future value of the investment opportunity. As of 2012, this value takes into account the uncertainty and potential for oil prices to rise, making the future investment worthwhile.

By viewing the initial exploration investment as a real option, Artic Oil's management can make informed decisions based on the evolving market conditions, optimizing their investment strategy and managing risks effectively.

### Real Options and the Resolution of Uncertainty

 In 2012 the company Artic Oil started exploration drillings in Nova Scotia, based on your analysis. That is, they purchased an option on the value of future oil production in 2015.
In the  years. 2012 until 2015, the oil industry has been under pressure with prices dropping significantly. What happened with the value of the option?
![Prices](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/Prices.png)

#### Impact on the Value of the Option

The value of a real option, such as the one held by Artic Oil, is highly dependent on the underlying asset—in this case, the price of oil. Here’s how the drop in oil prices impacted the value of the option:

1. **Initial Option Value (2012):**
   - In 2012, the initial exploration investment was made with the expectation of higher future oil prices. The option's value was based on the potential for favorable oil prices, making the future investment in full-scale production attractive.

2. **Oil Price Drop (2012-2015):**
   - The chart shows a significant decline in oil prices during this period. As oil prices dropped, the potential profitability of starting full-scale production decreased.
   - **Decreased Option Value:** As the underlying asset's value (oil prices) fell, the value of the option to invest in future production also decreased. The option became less attractive because the expected pay-off from exercising the option in 2015 diminished.

3. **Exercise Decision in 2015:**
   - By 2015, with oil prices significantly lower, the economic feasibility of investing in full-scale production was under pressure. The option might still have some value, but the likelihood of exercising the option decreased unless oil prices were expected to recover significantly in the near future.

##### Key Points Illustrated by the Chart

- **Oil Prices (2012-2015):** The chart shows oil prices hovering around $80-$100 per barrel in 2012, then dropping below $50 per barrel by early 2015, and remaining low through mid-2016.
- **Option Value Decrease:** As oil prices fell, the intrinsic value of the option (based on future potential revenues from oil production) decreased.
- **Strategic Decision Making:** Artic Oil's management would need to reassess the viability of further investments in 2015, considering the lower-than-expected oil prices.

The significant drop in oil prices between 2012 and 2015 led to a decrease in the value of Artic Oil's real option to invest in full-scale production. While the initial exploration investment purchased an option on future production, the declining oil prices reduced the attractiveness and potential profitability of exercising that option. This highlights the importance of market conditions in the valuation and strategic decisions associated with real options.


### The Value of Mining Options Under High Uncertainty

For a long time the oil industry had been characterized by highly volatile oil prices. The uncertainty in oil prices is often expressed as volatility or degree of variation. The graph below presents the monthly volatility of oil prices  over time. The y-axis represents the volatility, while the x-axis represents time. In the graph there are two distinct periods, period 1 and period 2.

![Volatility](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/Volatility.png)

Consider the development of an oil field as a real option. Disregarding other parameters, in which period would the real option value be higher? Explain your answer (Hint: A higher volatility suggests a wider future pay-off distribution).

- **Y-axis (Volatility):** Represents the volatility of oil prices.
- **X-axis (Time):** Represents time.

When considering the development of an oil field as a real option, the value of this option is influenced by the volatility of oil prices. A key insight from option pricing theory is that higher volatility increases the value of an option. This is because higher volatility suggests a wider distribution of potential future pay-offs, increasing the likelihood of very high returns, which outweighs the potential losses limited to the initial investment.

##### Analysis of the Two Periods

###### Period 1

- **Characteristics:** Lower volatility, relatively stable oil prices.
- **Implications for Option Value:** Lower volatility results in a narrower distribution of potential future pay-offs. The real option value is lower because the potential for extremely high returns is limited.

###### Period 2

- **Characteristics:** Higher volatility, significant fluctuations in oil prices.
- **Implications for Option Value:** Higher volatility results in a wider distribution of potential future pay-offs. The real option value is higher because the potential for extremely high returns increases, making the investment more attractive despite the associated risks.

The real option value would be higher in **Period 2**, when volatility is higher. This is because higher volatility enhances the potential for significant future pay-offs, increasing the overall value of the option to develop the oil field. Investors are more likely to value the option higher in periods of high volatility due to the increased potential for high returns.

### Game Theory in Bidding Contests

Consider a piece of land in which both a farmer and a project developer are interested.
The project developer wants to buy the piece of land so that he can use it for
the development of a real estate project, such as a large shopping mall. The
farmer wants to buy the piece of land to build himself a new home; he would
like to shift from his old land, since he likes the neighborhood of the new
land better. Both bidders assign different values for the piece of land based
on their plans.  In an acquisition, how can the fact that
the bidders have different plans with the target affect the outcome of the
bidding game and the acquisition premium?

#### 1. Different Valuations

##### a. Project Developer's Perspective
- **Higher Valuation:** The project developer likely assigns a higher value to the land due to the potential high returns from developing a large shopping mall. The future revenue from the commercial project could be substantial, leading the developer to place a high bid.
- **Strategic Importance:** The land may be strategically important for the developer’s overall project portfolio, influencing the willingness to pay a premium.

##### b. Farmer's Perspective
- **Lower Valuation:** The farmer assigns a value based on personal utility and the subjective benefit of living in a better neighborhood. This value is typically lower than the commercial value perceived by the developer.
- **Budget Constraints:** The farmer may also face budget constraints, limiting the maximum bid they can place.

#### 2. Strategic Behavior and Bidding Strategies

###### a. Winner’s Curse
- **Risk for Developer:** The developer might bid aggressively due to the high perceived value. However, this can lead to the winner’s curse, where the winner pays more than the actual value due to overestimation.
- **Conservative Bidding:** Knowing this risk, the developer might adopt a more conservative bidding strategy, aiming to balance between winning the bid and not overpaying.

###### b. Signal and Bluff
- **Farmer’s Strategy:** The farmer, knowing they have a lower valuation, might signal a higher interest than actual willingness to pay, hoping the developer reduces their bid. This bluff can work if the developer believes the farmer is a serious competitor.
- **Developer’s Response:** The developer, aware of the farmer's potential bluff, might strategically outbid by just enough to win, avoiding excessive premiums.

#### 3. Acquisition Premium

The acquisition premium, which is the amount paid above the intrinsic value of the land, can be influenced by:

##### a. Competitive Bidding
- **Higher Premium:** Intense competition, especially if both bidders are keen to acquire the land, can drive up the price, resulting in a high acquisition premium.
- **Information Asymmetry:** If one bidder is better informed about the land’s potential, they might be willing to pay a higher premium, exploiting the information advantage.

##### b. Differentiated Value
- **Developer’s Higher Bid:** The project developer’s higher valuation due to potential commercial gains can lead to a higher bid, setting a higher acquisition premium.
- **Farmer’s Reservation Price:** The farmer’s lower maximum willingness to pay sets a floor for the bidding, but the premium is primarily driven by the developer’s valuation.

#### 4. Game Theory Insights

###### a. Nash Equilibrium
- **Optimal Bids:** Both parties will strategize to find their optimal bidding amount. In a Nash equilibrium, each bidder’s strategy is optimal given the other’s strategy. The developer might bid up to their highest valuation minus a small margin to outbid the farmer, while the farmer bids up to their budget limit.

###### b. Auction Types
- **First-Price Sealed-Bid:** Both bidders submit one bid without knowing the other’s bid. The highest bidder wins, paying their bid amount. Here, the developer is likely to win but must bid carefully to avoid overpaying.
- **Second-Price Sealed-Bid (Vickrey Auction):** The highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid. This format encourages bidders to bid their true value. The developer would win and pay slightly above the farmer’s bid.

In an acquisition where bidders have different plans and valuations for the target land, the outcome and acquisition premium are influenced by the strategic interplay of bids. The project developer, with a higher commercial valuation, is likely to win but must navigate potential overpayment risks. The farmer, with a lower personal valuation, can influence the bidding strategy through signals and potential bluffs. Understanding these dynamics through game theory helps both parties optimize their bids, resulting in a competitive yet strategic bidding process.

### A Bidding Contest as a Game

Now consider how to solve a bidding situation using principles of game
theory. In a bidding game, two competing investors (A and B) enter into a
bidding game for a target by submitting either a high bid or a low bid for the target company at the same time. The payoff (= value - price) in each scenario is
presented in the game in the matrix below. What is the best strategy for Bidder
A? (Hint 1: which row does Bidder A prefer, given the decisions Bidder B can
make?) (Hint 2: depending on the preference of Bidder A, which column will
Bidder B prefer?).
![PayOff](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/PayOff.png)

#### Step 1: Analyzing Bidder A's Preferences
Bidder A needs to decide whether to submit a high bid or a low bid. To make this decision, we compare the payoffs for Bidder A in each scenario:

- If Bidder B chooses a **High Bid**:
  - Bidder A's payoff with a High Bid: 1
  - Bidder A's payoff with a Low Bid: 0

- If Bidder B chooses a **Low Bid**:
  - Bidder A's payoff with a High Bid: 20
  - Bidder A's payoff with a Low Bid: 10

From these comparisons:
- When Bidder B chooses High Bid, Bidder A prefers to choose High Bid (1 > 0).
- When Bidder B chooses Low Bid, Bidder A prefers to choose High Bid (20 > 10).

#### Step 2: Dominant Strategy for Bidder A
Since Bidder A prefers to choose a High Bid in both cases (regardless of Bidder B's choice), the High Bid is a dominant strategy for Bidder A.

#### Step 3: Analyzing Bidder B's Response
Given that Bidder A will choose a High Bid, we need to analyze Bidder B's best response:
- If Bidder A chooses a **High Bid**:
  - Bidder B's payoff with a High Bid: -1
  - Bidder B's payoff with a Low Bid: 0

From these comparisons:
- When Bidder A chooses High Bid, Bidder B prefers to choose Low Bid (0 > -1).

#### Step 4: Nash Equilibrium
The Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are making the best decision they can, given the decision of the other player. In this scenario:
- Bidder A's best strategy is to choose High Bid.
- Given Bidder A's High Bid, Bidder B's best strategy is to choose Low Bid.

Thus, the Nash equilibrium is:
- Bidder A: High Bid
- Bidder B: Low Bid

Resulting in payoffs of (20, 0).

The best strategy for Bidder A is to submit a High Bid. This strategy leads to a Nash equilibrium where Bidder A submits a High Bid, and Bidder B submits a Low Bid, resulting in payoffs of (20, 0).

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) 


![DCF](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/DCF.png)

#### DCF and real options & games - Equity Value = net value of assets in place (excl. debt) + growth option value

![DCF](https://github.com/isadays/Valuation-Strategy/blob/main/DCF2.png)

#### Overview of company valuation
1.) Historical performance and estimation of FCF (identify key value drivers, forecast profit and loss account, balance sheet, and cash flow statement)
2.) Perform discounted cash flow valuation (determine the WACC, determine FCF and terminal value, estimate enterprise and equity value, perform sensitivity analysis )
3.) Perform multiple valuation (identification of comparable firms, determination of appropriate valuation multiples)
