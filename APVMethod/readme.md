Why do we sometimes use the APV method instead of the WACC method to calculate the value of a company?

While the WACC method is widely used and appropriate for companies with stable capital structures, the APV method offers greater flexibility and precision in valuing firms with changing capital structures, complex financing arrangements, and different tax scenarios. By separating the operating value from the financing effects, the APV method can provide a clearer understanding of the sources of value and the impact of financing decisions.

The WACC method assumes that the company will be financed with a constant debt/equity ratio. Although the effects of a time varying D/E ratio can be incorporated in a recursive WACC, it is much easier and more accurate to use the APV method.
