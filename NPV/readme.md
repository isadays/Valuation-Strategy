In 2003 Tesla Motors Inc. was founded by Martin Eberhard en Marc Tarpenning. A year later Elon Musk decided to invest a large amount of money to start the development of the "Tesla Roadster".

One of the major car manufacturers has also become interested in investing in electric cars. They are still in the early stages of developing a fully electric car and management is a bit skeptic about the profitability of the investment. The R&D program involved multiple stages and required immediate capital outlays, while the cash inflows would be expected at a later point in time, as shown in the figure below. Management uses an opportunity cost of capital of 16% and a risk-free rate of 2%. Cash inflows are discounted with the cost of capital and cash outflows are discounted with the risk-free rate.

The management of the company is having doubts whether they should invest in the development of the new electric car. However, you mention to them that they do not have to commit to both stages immediately. Instead they could invest in the R&D stage to create the option to commercialize later when the circumstances are right (i.e. they have the option to invest in the commercial project).

Suppose that the (gross) value of expected future cash inflows (V) may fluctuate in line with the random fluctuation in demand (u = 1.4, d = 0.7 per period). Also assume a risk-neutral probability of p = 0.457.

What is the static NPV of this project? Please use a period to indicate the decimal position (e.g. 360.10 instead of 360,10).
